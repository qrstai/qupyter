# Code of Conduct

## Introduction

The Qupyter Python package is an open-source project developed by the Qupyter Team, and we welcome contributions and collaboration from individuals and the community. To ensure that the Qupyter project remains a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment for everyone, we have established this Code of Conduct that applies to all contributors, maintainers, and participants in the project.

## Our Pledge

In the spirit of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to:

1. **Be Respectful:** We will treat all individuals with respect and dignity, regardless of their background, identity, or differences.

2. **Be Inclusive:** We will strive to create an inclusive and diverse community where everyone feels welcome to contribute, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, age, or religion.

3. **Be Collaborative:** We encourage open and constructive collaboration among contributors and maintainers. Disagreements may arise, but we will seek to resolve them respectfully and professionally.

4. **Show Empathy:** We will strive to understand the perspectives and experiences of others and be considerate and empathetic in our interactions.

5. **Respect Privacy:** We will respect the privacy and confidentiality of others, including not sharing personal information without explicit consent.

6. **Report Concerns:** We encourage individuals to report any behavior that they believe violates this Code of Conduct to the project maintainers. We are committed to addressing such concerns promptly and discreetly.

## Unacceptable Behavior

We do not tolerate behavior that undermines the principles of this Code of Conduct, including but not limited to:

1. **Harassment:** Harassment, in any form, is unacceptable. This includes, but is not limited to, offensive comments, verbal abuse, intimidation, stalking, and unwelcome attention.

2. **Discrimination:** Discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, age, religion, or any other personal characteristic is not tolerated.

3. **Trolling and Disruptive Behavior:** Deliberately inflammatory or disruptive behavior that hinders productive discussion and collaboration is not welcome.

4. **Personal Attacks:** Personal attacks, insults, or derogatory comments directed at individuals or groups are not acceptable.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers are responsible for enforcing this Code of Conduct. Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to the maintainers via the project's communication channels. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject contributions, comments, issues, and other interactions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. Participants who violate this Code of Conduct may be temporarily or permanently banned from participating in the project.
